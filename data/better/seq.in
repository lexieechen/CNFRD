We have many, many locations behind us, by the way. We cover the — this country in large part. So the world, by the way — we’re not going to be talking about the world right now.

"From a friend at the Stanford hospital board. This is their feedback on Corona virus: The new Coronavirus may not show sign of infection for many days. How can one know if he/she is infected? By the time they have fever and/or cough and go to the hospital, the lung is usually 50% Fibrosis and it's too late...Taiwan experts provide a simple self-check that we can do every morning. Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stiffness or tightness, etc., it proves there is no Fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicates no infection. In critical time, please self-check every morning in an environment with clean air
Serious excellent advice by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases: Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat are moist, never dry. Take a few sips of water every 15 minutes at least. Why? Even if the virus gets into your mouth, drinking water or other liquids will wash them down through your throat and into the stomach. Once there, your stomach acid will kill all the virus. If you don’t drink enough water more regularly, the virus can enter your windpipe and into the lungs. That's very dangerous. Please send and share this with family and friends. Take care everyone and may the world recover from this Coronavirus soon. Please forward to your kids and friends

That one-time funding, which Congress originally appropriated in response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014, ran out at the end of September 2019

Alcohol-based hand-sanitizers are effective for inactivation of commonly transmitted bacteria and viruses, especially lipid-enveloped viruses like coronaviruses
Experts recommend working the sanitizer fully over both hands until completely dry

The new coronavirus, also known as 2019 novel coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV, and HIV, largely based on an unpublished manuscript by scientists in India

There a patent for the coronavirus from 2015
A patent expire on January 22, 2020 for the new coronavirus, and it proves the virus was invented. There’s magically already a vaccine available
So let me get this straight about this virus. It’s “new” yet it was lab created and patented in 2015 (in development since 03). The patent expired (today) on the day the first case is announced in the US. The patent also tells us the CDC helped make this! “This invention was made by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency of the United States Government. Therefore, the U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.” And now magically a vaccine is in the works for it already? Yet the patent in 2015 already references a vaccine for it. But what do I know I’m just a conspiracy theorist

The curfew will stop the spread of the virus, as it can survive only for 12 hours
To prevent community transmission, the virus needs to be curbed totally for 12 to 14 hours
With the Prime Minister calling for Janata Curfew on March 22, India prepares to avoid crucial Stage 3 community transmission of Coronavirus in the country. Italy tried implementing a similar nationwide curfew to prevent Stage 3, but to the lack of support from the citizens, the efforts failed, resulting in the death of thousands of people to the pandemic. We don't want such a crisis in India and I urge everyone to rise to the occasion and participate in the Janata Curfew by strictly staying indoors and practising social-distancing
PM Modi with great foresight called for the Janta Curfew. The Coronavirus has a shelf life of 12 hours. Modi asked the public to observe Janta Curfew from 7am to 9pm on Sunday. That means if we give a gap of 14 hours, we can be able to break the chain of infection. And that results in the cure of the disease by the third week. This also gives the chance to concentrate on providing the cure for already infected people. This is the ultimate truth behind Janta Curfew
Coronavirus becomes ineffective in 12 hours. And Janata Curfew is for 14 hours. So you can now understand it is such a huge masterstroke, which none of the other nations have applied
Clapping together is enough to destroy and reduce the spread of the infection

I was a bartender for almost 10yrs, if it snowed on a Sat night, that could be a third of your weekly income gone. #COVID is so much worse. The Congress needs to pass a stimulus for workers - not investors. Rent, medical, food. They need to start planning for it now

Local media @StandNewsHK reveals that the first case of #WuhanPneumonia has been confirmed this afternoon and that he travelled to Hong kong using the high-speed rail. And the patient is being hospitalised at Queen Elizabeth Hospital
Caixin removed its paywall for all #WuhanCoronavirus related articles in Chinese, publishing a series of reports on the ground from Wuhan and Guangzhou, WHO conference in Geneva, expert interviews in Hong Kong and Washington DC. It has done a huge service to the public

As everyone has a mild freak out about coronavirus, it's worth pointing out that the CDC says 6,600-17,000 people have died from the flu so far this year and between 13 million and 18 million people have been infected by the flu virus

Years ago, there was this scientific forum, they were asked what could be the most probably way for mankind to end. War, asteroid impact, global warming, etc. First probable cause was an engineered plague. Curiously they quarantined Wuhan and cancelled all new year celebrations
The problem with Chinese is they are not very good at managing crises. I suspect this is not some "random" occurrence of virus. Probably something got leaked from a research center in Wuhan by accident. Like ASF that wiped out half of the pig population in China the past year

There's no evidence to support the conspiracy theory that 5G networks cause Covid-19 or contribute to its spread. But still, it won't go away. Here's what to know about 5G networks, how false theories came about and why they don't hold up
Hi there, thanks for getting in touch. There is no evidence that Covid-19 is linked with 5G. You can find more information on some of the false claims circulating about coronavirus here:
Zee news deletes tweet and story claiming #Covid_19 patients from Tableeghi Jamat attacked medical team, after Firozabad police terms the report "false and misleading" and denies any attack on medical team or ambulance
"A report that China also lifted its year-old ban on Canadian canola exports proved to be false"
Claims that Black Men are worst paying child support are absolute lies & ABSOLUTELY FALSE propaganda Black Men pay Child Support BETTER than ANY other ethnic group As a group we'll be impacted LESS than ANY OTHER by rule to withhold from Covid 19 help checks
A video of dead bodies of immigrants washed ashore on a Libyan beach in 2014 is viral with the false claim that coronavirus victims are being thrown into the sea in many countries. #AltNewsFactCheck |

No, images didn't show Italian patients treated on the streets (they were earthquake victims in Croatia)

n South Africa, a video claiming testing kits were contaminated was widely shared on social media.In the video, a man calls on South Africans to refuse swab tests, which check if someoneThe clip begins with the man having a swab stuck up his nose. "Do not under any circumstances allow them to test you. There's a possibility that the swabs are contaminated with Covid-19," he says. currently has the virus.In the video, a man calls on South Africans to refuse swab tests, which check if someone currently has the virusHe alleges that people globally are saying the swabs are being used to spread the virus, and refers to reports in the UK that test kits there were contaminated.But this is misleading - the tests were giving false positive readings, it wasn't that the swabs were contaminated with the actual virus
There are widely-shared social media posts claiming that African people are to be used as guinea pigs to test a new coronavirus vaccine.However, such claims are false - there is no vaccine for Covid-19 and only a number of clinical trials are taking place, none of them currently in African countries
An evangelical preacher who claims he can cure the virus has also been the subject of disinformation.Stories about David Kingleo Elijah, from the Glorious Mount of Possibility Church started spreading online after a video of him saying he would move to China to "destroy" the virus was uploaded on YouTube and shared on other platforms."I am going prophetically to destroy coronavirus. I am going to China, I want to destroy coronavirus," he says in the video
The WHO (World Health Organization) says that while it is "a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties", there's no evidence that eating garlic can protect people from the new coronavirus
Sather and others promoted the substance even before the coronavirus outbreak, and in January he tweeted that, "not only is chlorine dioxide (aka MMS) an effective cancer cell killer, it can wipe out coronavirus too"
But these recipes, alleged dupes for one of the country's most popular brands, were for a disinfectant better suited for cleaning surfaces and, as scientists pointed out, not suitable for use on skin
The idea that it could be an effective treatment for coronavirus has been widely shared on Facebook, particularly by "medical freedom" groups which are deeply suspicious of mainstream medical advice.Proponents of colloidal silver claim it can treat all kinds of health conditions, act as an antiseptic, and state it helps the immune system. There are some occasional uses of silver in healthcare, for example in bandages applied to wounds, but that doesn't mean it's effective to consume.There's clear advice from the US health authorities that there's no evidence this type of silver solution is effective for any health condition. More importantly,?it could cause serious side effects?including kidney damage, seizures and argyria - a condition that makes your skin turn blue
Professor Trudie Lang at the University of Oxford says there is "no biological mechanism" that would support the idea that you can just wash a respiratory virus down into your stomach and kill it.Infections like coronaviruses enter the body via the respiratory tract when you breathe in. Some of them might go into your mouth, but even constantly drinking water isn't going to prevent you from catching the virus
Charlotte Gornitzka, who works for Unicef on coronavirus misinformation, says: "A recent erroneous online message...purporting to be a Unicef communication appears to indicate that avoiding ice cream and other cold foods can help prevent the onset of the disease. This is, of course, wholly untrue."

Google is helping to develop a website. It’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location. We have many, many locations behind us, by the way. We cover the — this country in large part. So the world, by the way — we’re not going to be talking about the world right now.

"From a friend at the Stanford hospital board. This is their feedback on Corona virus: The new Coronavirus may not show sign of infection for many days. How can one know if he/she is infected? By the time they have fever and/or cough and go to the hospital, the lung is usually 50% Fibrosis and it's too late...Taiwan experts provide a simple self-check that we can do every morning. Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stiffness or tightness, etc., it proves there is no Fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicates no infection. In critical time, please self-check every morning in an environment with clean air
Serious excellent advice by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases: Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat are moist, never dry. Take a few sips of water every 15 minutes at least. Why? Even if the virus gets into your mouth, drinking water or other liquids will wash them down through your throat and into the stomach. Once there, your stomach acid will kill all the virus. If you don’t drink enough water more regularly, the virus can enter your windpipe and into the lungs. That's very dangerous. Please send and share this with family and friends. Take care everyone and may the world recover from this Coronavirus soon. Please forward to your kids and friends
If you have a runny nose and sputum, you have a common cold. Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose
On fabric it can survive for 6-12 hours. normal laundry detergent will kill coronavirus
Drinking warm water is effective for all viruses. Try not to drink liquids with ice
You should also gargle as a prevention. A simple solution of salt in warm water will suffice

The Trump administration cut the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s anti-pandemic work in over 40 countries to just 10

So let me get this straight about this virus. It’s “new” yet it was lab created and patented in 2015 (in development since 03). The patent expired (today) on the day the first case is announced in the US. The patent also tells us the CDC helped make this! “This invention was made by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency of the United States Government. Therefore, the U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.” And now magically a vaccine is in the works for it already? Yet the patent in 2015 already references a vaccine for it.

The curfew will stop the spread of the virus, as it can survive only for 12 hours
To prevent community transmission, the virus needs to be curbed totally for 12 to 14 hours
With the Prime Minister calling for Janata Curfew on March 22, India prepares to avoid crucial Stage 3 community transmission of Coronavirus in the country. Italy tried implementing a similar nationwide curfew to prevent Stage 3, but to the lack of support from the citizens, the efforts failed, resulting in the death of thousands of people to the pandemic. We don't want such a crisis in India and I urge everyone to rise to the occasion and participate in the Janata Curfew by strictly staying indoors and practising social-distancing
PM Modi with great foresight called for the Janta Curfew. The Coronavirus has a shelf life of 12 hours. Modi asked the public to observe Janta Curfew from 7am to 9pm on Sunday. That means if we give a gap of 14 hours, we can be able to break the chain of infection. And that results in the cure of the disease by the third week. This also gives the chance to concentrate on providing the cure for already infected people. This is the ultimate truth behind Janta Curfew
Coronavirus becomes ineffective in 12 hours. And Janata Curfew is for 14 hours. So you can now understand it is such a huge masterstroke, which none of the other nations have applied
Clapping together is enough to destroy and reduce the spread of the infection
